## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

1. **Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root with:

   ```text
   DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/‚Ä¶/‚Ä¶
   ```

2. **Script Constants** (if you prefer inline config)

   - `USER_DATA_DIR`: folder to store Chrome profile (`./discord-user-data`)
   - `CHROME_PATH`: path to your Chrome executable

     - macOS default: `/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome`

   - `CHANNEL_URL`: full Discord URL: `https://discord.com/channels/<GUILD_ID>/<CHANNEL_ID>`
   - `FILTER_PHRASES`: array of mention strings to filter (empty = no filter)
   - `POLL_INTERVAL_MS`: time (ms) between channel scans
   - `COOLDOWN_MS`: wait (ms) after clicking before next scan

3. **Discord Webhook Setup**

   - In your Discord server, go to **Channel Settings ‚û° Integrations ‚û° Webhooks**
   - **Create** a new webhook and copy its URL
   - Paste into your `.env`

---

## üíª Usage

```bash
node autojoin_queue_discord_webhook.js
```

1. The script will launch Chrome, navigate to your Discord channel, and wait for new Godpack announcements.
2. When a new pack appears and matches any `FILTER_PHRASES`, the bot clicks **Join**, then sends a webhook notification.
3. If an image URL is available, the bot will automatically identify the cards in the godpack and include them in the notification.
4. A 15‚ÄØs cooldown prevents duplicate clicks.

### Testing Card Identification

You can test the card identification feature separately:

```bash
node test_card_identification.js
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tips & Troubleshooting

- **First‚Äëtime login**: The Chrome window will open in non‚Äëheadless mode. Log in to Discord manually if needed. Your session will be saved.
- **Filter debugging**: The script logs the exact text it tests against your filters‚Äîadjust your `FILTER_PHRASES` accordingly.
- **Webhook errors**: Ensure `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` is correct. Test with the included `test-webhook.js` snippet.
- **Card identification**: Make sure Python and the required packages are installed. The script supports all major card sets.
- **Dependencies**: If Discord‚Äôs UI changes, you may need to update the CSS selectors in the script.
